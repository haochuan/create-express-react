# create-express-react

Get started with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and your own [express](https://expressjs.com/) server for development and production.

## Features

- CLI to generate project structure
- Fully ES6 support
- Pre-written npm scripts to help development, testing, linting, building and deployment process
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for both frontend and backend
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for both frontend and backend

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), from v0.12.x to the latest version. Using any version of v6.x.x or above is prefered.

### Installing

First of all, you should install `create-express-react` via npm as a global package, this is the CLI to generate the template for you to get started.

```
npm install create-express-react -g
```

Once you have `create-express-react`, then run it to create the template. The command below will generate a folder named `myApp` in `Desktop`.

```
cd ~/Desktop
create-express-react myApp
```

Then you need to grab `create-react-app` by running:

```
cd ~/myApp
npm install
npm run setup
```

Finally you can start your app:

```
npm start
```
